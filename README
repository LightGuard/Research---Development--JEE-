PRE-REQS
================================================================================
1. Gradle
  Go to http://www.gradle.org and download gradle-0.7-all.zip.  Unzip gradle
  wherever you like, but make sure it's on your PATH.  You may need to 
  restart Terminal or simply source (that's the command) your .bashrc /
  .profile / whatever file so it shows up on the path.  You can verify this
  by executing printenv | grep PATH and looking to see if GRADLE_HOME/bin
  is correctly on your PATH.

BUILDING
================================================================================
Usage of gradle is very similar to ant.  Simple cd to the project directory and
execute gradle compile.

NOTE: You can see the list of tasks available via gradle -t

RUNNING
================================================================================
This project can be run from the command line using jetty by using the 
jettyRun and jettyRunWar (more information is available at
http://www.gradle.org/0.7/docs/userguide/jetty_plugin.html).

GENERATING ECLIPSE PROJECT
================================================================================
Execute gradle eclipse and a new eclipseWTP project will be created with all of
the needed libraries.
